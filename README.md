![Certificate](Coursera YQTJMSQEQCR3.pdf)

## Overview

Welcome to my repository showcasing my journey through the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization** offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). This specialization, available on Coursera, provides comprehensive training in NLP, covering essential topics such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and attention models.

## Specialization Highlights

### Course 1: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
- **Key Topics:** Word vectors, sentiment analysis, machine translation.
- **Projects:** Implemented sentiment analysis models and evaluated their performance.

### Course 2: Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
- **Key Topics:** Hidden Markov models, POS tagging, named entity recognition.
- **Projects:** Developed language models and sequence prediction algorithms.

### Course 3: Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
- **Key Topics:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs.
- **Projects:** Built models for text generation and machine translation.

### Course 4: Natural Language Processing with Attention Models
- **Key Topics:** Attention mechanism, Transformer models.
- **Projects:** Applied attention-based models for advanced NLP tasks.

## Projects and Assignments

This repository includes the following notable projects and assignments:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Developed a model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

2. **Machine Translation**
   - Created a sequence-to-sequence model for translating English sentences to French.

3. **Text Generation**
   - Built a model to generate text based on given input sequences.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Implemented a model to identify and classify entities in text.
